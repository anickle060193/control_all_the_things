# Control All The Things
An application interface to control an Arduino or similar microcontroller board from a simple GUI computer application.

The computer application is written in C# using Visual Studio. The embedded side is written in C++ using the [PlatformIO](http://platformio.org/) plugin for [Atom](https://atom.io/).

The application and embedded code use [CmdMessenger](https://github.com/thijse/Arduino-CmdMessenger) to communicate between them.
